# NaV-currents-in-VGN-spiking

Contains code associated with Baeza-Loya and Eatock, 2023; this includes associated code for our Hodgkin-Huxley model with extended sodium currents for vestibular ganglion neuron spiking, voltage clamp models of multiple voltage-gated sodium currents, and minor scripts for statistical analysis and EPSC fitting.

To run the spiking (current clamp) simulation, use Single_Compartment_Annotated in VGN_Model_New_Sodium folder.

To run the current (voltage clamp) simulation, use a_Voltage_clamp_primary from NaV_Current_VC_Sims folder.
